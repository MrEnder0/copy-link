# Copy-Link

I made this at like 12 and worked on it until 4am (at the time of writing this) after drinking a bunch of energy drinks... Idk why I made it but at least I can say I used handlebars before I guess.
To sum it up this rocket powered website will display any text which is inside the url path and allow you to copy it by clicking on some fancy link icon thats it.

## Usage

To use compile with cargo, make sure you have ![protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) installed to compile its dependencies.
