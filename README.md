# copy-link

I made this at like 12 and worked on it until 4am (at the time of writting this) after drinking a bunch of cokes... Idk why I made it but at least I can say I used handlebars before I guess.

To sum it up this rocket powered website will display any text which is inside the url path and allow you to copy it by clicking on some fany link icon thats it.

To use compile with cargo, make sure you have ![protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) to compile its dependencies.
